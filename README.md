# Razelab Repo for GoHackathon 2017

## Ideas
Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia) is one of the biggest language in the world with hundreds of millions of users around the world. It has huge potential in terms of people development, automation, and business. Meanwhile, chatting is one of the biggest portion of peope's activities in mobile domain.

We are interested in enhancing people's in-app experience with interactive and contextful chat. By creating this open AI concept, we will let people or businesses train their communication data, and enhance their context in communication and automation.

For this hackathon, we will develop a simple AI engine which targets specific task related to Gojek Services:

Understanding location context
Understanding number/price context
Understanding identity context
Other contexts, this depends on available time during this hackathon.
Many applications will benefit from this engine, such as chat bot application, public service automation, task automation, etc. 3rd party service providers may connect their application as Engine's outputs and actions, to enrich people's experience.

As added value, we will try automate building process by following CI (continuous integration) and CD (continuous delivery) principals. We value speed and quality so the process of the development can be agile, without compromising the deliverable product.
